# AirBnb clone - The console
# Description
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project which is a project to clone a simple version of the AirBnB website and deploy it to the server.

# Usage
The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode like a unix shell. It prints a prompt (hbnb) and waits for the user to input command.

| Command         |  Example              |
------------------|-----------------------
| Run the console | ./console.py          |
| Quit            | (hbnb) quit           |
| Display help    | (hbnb) help <command> |
